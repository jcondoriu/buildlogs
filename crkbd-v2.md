## Firmware

### Install/Configure QMK

First to compile the crkbd qmk firmware you will need to use avr-gcc 8. 

In Arch use the following commands to install the dependencies:
```bash
sudo pacman --needed -U https://archive.archlinux.org/packages/a/avr-gcc/avr-gcc-8.3.0-1-x86_64.pkg.tar.xz
sudo pacman -S --needed \
       arm-none-eabi-binutils \
       arm-none-eabi-gcc \
       arm-none-eabi-newlib \
       avrdude \
       avr-binutils \
       avr-libc \
       base-devel \
       clang \
       dfu-programmer \
       dfu-util \
       diffutils \
       gcc \
       git \
       libusb-compat \
       python \
       python-pip \
       unzip \
       wget \
       zip
```

Then clone the [qmk firmware](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware) and then

### Compile/Flash Firmware

```bash 
make crkbd:default:flash
```

This will compile and start to flash the firmware, make sure your pro-micro is connected in the usb port and the following message will be shown:
```bash
QMK Firmware 0.9.19
WARNING:
 Can not run bin/qmk! This tool will be required when the develop branch is merged on 2020 Aug 29.

 Please run util/qmk_install.sh to install all the dependencies QMK requires.

At this moment, with some tweezers, reset the pro-micro
![Reseting Pro-Micro](/construo/keyboard-crkbd/01-flashing-the-firmware-1.jpg)

If you did right the following will be shown:

Do this for both pro-micros and you good to go.

## Building

### Mark pcbs sides

This is self explanatory, but is very helpfull to mark your pcbs sides.

![Marking Pcbs](/construo/keyboard-crkbd/02-marking-pcb-sides.jpg)

### Solder OLED jumper pads

You need to solder the oled jumper pads in order to use oleds.
![OLED jumper pads](/construo/keyboard-crkbd/02-jumper-oled-1.jpg)

### Soldering Pin Sockets 

I had to double check sometimes to see if I was soldering in the right side of the pcb, that's why marking the pcbs before helps a lot thought the process.
![Pin Connetors 1](/construo/keyboard-crkbd/03-soldering-pin-connector-1.jpg)
The other problem I had was that the PCB is designed to work in both sides, so you have 2 sets of holes to solder your pro micro, the trick to know which hole to use is use the ones that are inside a white box line looking from above.
![Pin Connetors 2](/construo/keyboard-crkbd/03-soldering-pin-connector-2.jpg)
From bellow the holes are passing thought the white line.
![Pin Connetors 3](/construo/keyboard-crkbd/03-soldering-pin-connector-3.jpg)

### Solder diodes

The SMD diodes are trick at first, they are pretty small and they have polarity, make sure to match the polarity with PCB.
![Solder diodes 1](/construo/keyboard-crkbd/04-soldering-diodes-1.jpg)

To make it easier to solder, first put some solder on one of the PCB diode contacts and then with a tweezer hold the diode over the solder and heat it to stick the diode, proceed to the other diode contact and solder it normally.
![Solder diodes 2](/construo/keyboard-crkbd/04-soldering-diodes-2.jpg)

All diodes soldered.
![Solder diodes 3](/construo/keyboard-crkbd/04-soldering-diodes-3.jpg)

On both PCBs
![Solder diodes 4](/construo/keyboard-crkbd/04-soldering-diodes-4.jpg)

### Prepare copper wire to be the new pro-micro/OLED male pin

Instead of using thru-hole diode legs for this step, I experimented doing the male pin legs with some 0.5mm copper wire, the only down side doing this is that the copper wire I bought came covered with a thin plastic layer that I had to remove in order to make it electrical conductor.
![Pro copper legs 1](/construo/keyboard-crkbd/05-copper-wire-pin-1.jpg)

Left wire is the one I sanded out the plastic compared with how it came on the right.
![Pro copper legs 2](/construo/keyboard-crkbd/05-copper-wire-pin-2.jpg)

I used some masking tape to help me organize the wires.
![Pro copper legs 3](/construo/keyboard-crkbd/05-copper-wire-pin-3.jpg)

### Solder pro-micro male sockets "legs"

Also another benefit of using masking tape is to don't let the solder go thought the hole and "glue" with the PCB socket.
![Solder pro-micro male 1](/construo/keyboard-crkbd/06-soldering-pro-micro-1.jpg)

Is a good idea to use some solder flux on the copper wires to help with the soldering
![Solder pro-micro male 2](/construo/keyboard-crkbd/06-soldering-pro-micro-2.jpg)

On both PCBs
![Solder pro-micro male 3](/construo/keyboard-crkbd/06-soldering-pro-micro-3.jpg)

### Rewire oled socket with new "legs"

This was the hardest part of all project, de-soldering the OLED current pins without a good solder sucker wasn't a good idea. 
![Rewire oled 1](/construo/keyboard-crkbd/10-soldering-oled-1.jpg)

I was so frustrated with the results that I forgot to take pictures of this process.
![Rewire oled 2](/construo/keyboard-crkbd/10-soldering-oled-2.jpg)

### Solder TRRS

An easy thru-hole solder, just had to straight the component legs before.
![Soldering TTRS 1](/construo/keyboard-crkbd/07-soldering-ttrs-jack-1.jpg)

Result from above.
![Soldering TTRS 2](/construo/keyboard-crkbd/07-soldering-ttrs-jack-2.jpg)

### Manual test

At this moment I had enough to setup a manual test, to check if all I did until here was ok.
![Manual Test 1](/construo/keyboard-crkbd/08-first-testing-1.jpg)

I when to [keyboardtester](https://www.keyboardtester.com) and plugged the new keyboard to the PC.
![Manual Test 2](/construo/keyboard-crkbd/08-first-testing-2.jpg)

I simulated the switch behaviour with the tweezer.
![Manual Test 3](/construo/keyboard-crkbd/08-first-testing-3.jpg)

### Solder reset

Again an easy step, just had to straight the component legs before.
![Soldering reset 1](/construo/keyboard-crkbd/09-soldering-reset-button-1.jpg)

Result from above.
![Soldering reset 2](/construo/keyboard-crkbd/09-soldering-reset-button-2.jpg)

### Solder hot-swaps

Very similar to soldering the diodes, but with a way bigger component.
![Solder hot-swaps](/construo/keyboard-crkbd/11-soldering-kailh-hotswap-1.jpg)

### Mount the case

Just some screws and the build was almost finished.
![Mount the case 1](/construo/keyboard-crkbd/12-mounting-case-1.jpg)

Adding the switches over the case.
![Mount the case 2](/construo/keyboard-crkbd/12-mounting-switches-1.jpg)

Checking if all is working before the keycaps
![Mount the case 3](/construo/keyboard-crkbd/12-mounting-switches-2.jpg)

#### Final product
![Final](/construo/keyboard-crkbd/13-mounting-keycaps-1.jpg)

### (optional) Wood Wristrest

I asked my father to create some wristrest for this project.
![Wood Wristrest 1](/construo/keyboard-crkbd/14-finished-wood-writesrest-1.jpg)

I didn't made much in this step, but just helped him as an assistant, maybe in the future I will have enough wood skill to do so.
